                      Technological change is accelerating and the global economy is transforming in response. Automation
                      and artificial intelligence are in the process of making redundant the low-skilled jobs that many
                      Nigerians have yet to take. Thus, the majority of Nigerians are at serious risk of being left behind
                      unless there is an urgent technological revolution that can transform agriculture, education, and all
                      other spheres of public life.
                      Technology has the ability to unite all and remove barriers to economic transformation. To
                      unlock our national potential, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA)
                      proposes a number of urgent measures to connect, educate and enable digital innovation.
